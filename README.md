## Description

yourAkanName also provides an insight into the broader Akan Culture. It tells you of its mythology, art, music and history. Through given social media pages, you can follow and connect with Akan Culture online. Get to use the web app to know your Akan name and alongside see popular figures with whom you potentially share a name.

## Known Bugs
yourAkanName may take in dates in other formats aside from the recommended `dd-mm-yyyy`. The characters separating the date digits can be whichever characters you choose to use. 

On smaller viewports, you might have to scroll up to view your Akan name once you click on the 'Know Your Name' button. The website does not automatically scroll to the results section.
## Technologies Used
yourAkanName has been developed with JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML5 and CSS. JavaScript drives the Akan naming functions, Bootstrap makes the website responsive, HTML structures the website and CSS gives it the final aesthetics. Standard syntax and indentation has been used all through in accordance with coding best practices. Additional fonts have been imported from fontawesome. Version control has been made thus far through Git. The box model has largely been applied using divs to structure and style the website.
